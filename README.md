Got Rhythmn?

A project by Omari Wallace

Got Rhythm? is a social drumkit experiment that explores the HTML5 webaudio API integrated with socket.io for multiplayer gameplay.

Instructions: One user serves as the 'DJ' and runs one of the track loops.  Other users on the site can then play a sound on the drumkit that then gets emitted through the ** DJ's speakers ** (note: drum kit sound does not emit from your OWN client; but rather gets broadcasted to other users). Object of the game is to keep time with the track loops. So you've got to ask youself one question...got rhythmn?
