# GOT RHYTHM?

A project by **Omari Wallace**

**Got Rhythm?** is a social drumkit experiment that explores the HTML5 web audio API integrated with socket.io for multiplayer gameplay and three.js for musical visualizations.

**Instructions (Social Play):**
- Make sure all users have the switch enabled to "Party"
- One user serves as the 'DJ' and runs one of the track loops
- Other users on the site can then play a sound on the drumkit that then gets emitted through the _DJ's speakers_ (**note:** drum kit sound does not emit from your OWN client; but rather gets broadcasted to other users). Object of the game is to keep time with the DJ's track loops. So you've got to ask youself one question...got rhythm?
